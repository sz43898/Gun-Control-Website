		The conversation around the issue of gun violence has changed greatly in the past few years, with advocates and lawmakers
		continuing to fight for stronger safety measures.
		<br>
There is still clearly a lot of work left to be done. There were 251 mass shootings in the first six months of 2019 alone, according to the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org">Gun Violence Archive</a>, which tracks gun-related incidents in the United States. (The site defines "mass shooting" as an incident in which at least four people are either killed or wounded.)
<br>
<b>So, what can you do if you want to join this fight? Here are some ways:</b>


<p class="section">Support organizations working to reduce gun violence.</p>

<p class="tabtwo">
You can donate to or volunteer with national organizations that work to curb gun violence in the U.S. Many of them have local chapters you can join — if not, you can always start one!
<ul class="listtext">
<li><a href="https://everytown.org">Everytown for Gun Safety</a> advocates for gun reform legislation. It also has a political action committee (PAC) to support candidates who vow to fight gun violence. One of Everytown's arms is the grassroots organization <a href="https://momsdemandaction.org">Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America</a>, which helps organizers at the local level.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.bradyunited.org">The Brady Campaign</a> is one of the nation's oldest gun safety advocacy organizations. It pushes for gun safety policies but also for the enforcement of measures already on the books. One of its goals is to reduce gun deaths in half by 2025.</li>

<li><a href="https://giffords.org">Giffords Law Center</a>, which was founded by former congresswoman Gabby Giffords — who was shot in 2011 — and her husband Mark Kelly. This organization lobbies for gun safety legislation. It also has a political action committee (PAC) meant to elect lawmakers who support gun reform measures and unseat those who don't.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.csgv.org">The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence</a> is made up of 48 organizations working in tandem to reduce gun violence in America, from enacting safety measures to preventing gun-related suicides.</li>

<li><a href="https://supgv.org">States United to Prevent Gun Violence</a> is a grassroots network made up of 32 groups at the state level working to reduce gun violence through legislation, education, and community action.</li>
</ul>

<p class="section">Educate yourself and others about gun reform.</p>
<p class="tabtwo">
For some, gun reform can be a polarizing issue. To cut through misinformation, it is important to be educated. If you want to learn more about legislation targeted at reducing gun violence and why these measures matter, you can start reading <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/180912_egv_Toolkit.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p class="section">Voice your support on social media.</p>
<p class="tabtwo">
You can also lend your voice to the numerous social-media campaigns seeking to raise awareness of gun violence and gun-control legislation. There’s the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/march-for-our-lives-for-gun-control-will-be-on-march-24.html">#NeverAgain movement</a>, which was created after the Stoneman Douglas shooting by teenage survivors of the attack. You can also tweet at politicians and businesses to pressure them to act on gun-control (a move that seemed to have worked after <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/02/businesses-cut-nra-ties-as-pressure-campaign-mounts.html">a number of brands cut ties with the NRA</a> following a social-media campaign).
</p>
<p class="section">Volunteer with groups leading the fight.</p>
<p class="tabtwo">
Not only do gun-control organizations need donations, they could also use volunteers to help lead their grassroots efforts. <a href="https://wagv.org/get-involved/">Women Against Gun Violence</a> is asking people to volunteer just a few minutes a week to help them spread their message (it’s as simple as making a call or sending a letter). If you <a href="https://act.everytown.org/signup/get-involved-locally/">sign up on this page</a>, your local Moms Demand Action chapter will get in touch with ways you can get involved.

<p class="section">Pressure politicians to stop taking money from the NRA.</p>
<p class="tabtwo">
As Donald Trump pointed out, many members of the Republican party seem to be “afraid” of the NRA — as in, they don’t want to go against the gun lobby for fear of losing campaign donations or supporters. That’s why gun-control groups and advocates are <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/374784-gun-control-groups-take-out-230k-ny-times-ad-naming-lawmakers-who">calling out politicians who accept NRA money</a>. Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, for instance, recently took out a full-page ad in the New York Times, in which the groups list around 100 lawmakers, their phone numbers, and the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/national/senators-house-members-who-offered-condolences-after-shooting-called-out-for-donations-from-nra/tpitHXUY9jDH3pr4f7f7cM/">amount of money they received from the NRA</a>. The goal is to pressure politicians to <a href="https://mashable.com/2018/02/21/nra-new-york-times-everytown-ad/#cqDlv8pyXSqF">stop taking money from the gun lobby</a> — and actually help pass gun-control policy.
</p>
<p class="section">Reach out to your elected officials.</p>
<p class="tabtwo">
In addition to calling out politicians for taking money from the gun lobby, you can also reach out to your elected officials (whether they’re affiliated with the NRA or not) to let them know just how important gun-control is to you. If you’re not sure who your representatives are (or how to contact them), Everytown for Gun Safety makes the whole process pretty easy: just <a href="https://act.everytown.org/call/dont-gut-our-gun-laws/">fill out a form on their website</a>, and they’ll find the appropriate number for you to call in Congress. You can also visit <a href="http://physics.mnstate.edu/cabanela/contacting_the_congress_shutdown.php">ContactTheCongress.org</a> for more information on who you should contact and how to reach them.

<p class="section">Contact your elected officials.</p>


<p class="tabtwo">
  If preventing gun violence is a cause you're passionate about, you should contact your representatives and let them know. Remember, they work for you — so don't underestimate the power of pressuring those who hold public office! If you're not sure where to begin, here's a <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/01/138465/how-to-call-senator">handy guide</a> on how to contact your representatives in Congress. But it is equally important that you contact your local and state officials, whose decisions have an immediate impact on your daily life. <a href="https://openstates.org">Go here</a> to find out their contact information.

<p class="section">Vote, vote, vote.</p>
<p class="tabtwo">
  If you care about reducing gun violence in your community, you need to vote for the candidates up and down the ballot who will best represent your interests. Here's <a href="https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote">how to register to vote</a>.
