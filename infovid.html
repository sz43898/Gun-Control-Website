			<p><b>What students really think about school shootings: </b>
        <br>Vox asked students across the US to share their thoughts on school
				shootings. Over 1,600 responded.
				<br>
      To see how students across the country really felt about school shootings, Vox put out an open request for students to send us their thoughts. Here are some of their responses.
      <br>
      Gun violence, particularly school shootings, ranks among the most contentious issues in America. Since the February 14, 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, mass shootings have again become a staple of the news cycle.
<br>
This school shooting is distinguished from previous ones, because students around the nation have rallied to organize for safer schools. Whether that means stricter gun control, metal detectors, regulating ammunition sales, or arming teachers, remains unclear.

			<p><b>The gun solution we're not talking about: </b>
        <br>Universal background checks won't fix America's gun crisis. But there's something else that might. It seems like after every mass shooting, politicians talk about expanding background checks for gun buyers. But background checks don't actually do a great job of keeping dangerous people from getting guns. What does?

			<p><b>The state of gun violence in the US, explained in 18 charts:</b>
        <br>
        America doesn't have a gun problem, it has several of them.
        <br>
				These charts and maps break down the scope of the problem: <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/10/3/9444417/boulder-colorado-mass-shooting-gun-violence-america-usa">http://bit.ly/2odFYVK​</a>
        <br>
        No other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate as Canada, more than seven times as Sweden, and nearly 16 times as Germany. The debate over gun regulation in the US seems intractable, but there is one fact that both sides can agree on: Mass shootings are just the tip of a very complicated problem.

			<p><b>A Colorado shooting reignites gun control debate, in 180 seconds: </b>
        <br>Two recent mass shootings, one in Atlanta and the still-unfolding tragedy in Boulder, are conjuring up a pattern tragically familiar from the pre-pandemic United States. Senseless deaths followed by expressions of sympathy and prayer, followed by demands from gun-control advocates that the government do something—followed by resignation, and weary explanations of why random gun violence is the sort of thing Americans just have to live with.

			<p><b>How Parkland student David Hogg beats his critics: </b>
        <br>
        Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg has some strategies for dealing with smears and conspiracy theories. A Parkland shooting survivor on why teen activists won't be silenced: “We are teenagers
				who have nothing to lose.” - <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17031050/florida-shooting-parkland-advocacy-gun-control-delaney-tarr">http://bit.ly/2qMGudJ​</a>  
        <br>
        After surviving the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Hogg and his classmates became vocal activists in the fight for gun control. But that spotlight has made them prime targets for the right-wing smear machine: a collection of Fox News
				hosts like Laura Ingraham, conservative pundits, conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, Twitter provocateurs, and YouTube commentators who piled on to the teens in the wake of the shooting. 
        <br>
        Rather than crumbling under the pressure, they're using humor and advertiser pressure to keep their cause in the media spotlight while disarming their critics. In the face of intense media attention, the Parkland students are putting on a masterclass in how to deal with bullies.
